        Hello there, to whoever is reading this. Sorry for making such a statement so suddenly, but I'm planning on leaving Discord for good. I can't say it's permanent, but I'm not going back until the far, far future.<br><br>

        I've only noticed recently that I've been too obsessed with my friends for so long, often using this as a form of escapism when my life gets too overwhelming, and it's honestly unhealthy. I don't feel like I'm progressing in life at all, meanwhile my friends have been more focused on their life and are very inactive in the friend group.<br><br>

        I, on the other hand, never changed for the better at all. I'm still constantly staring at Discord looking for new messages, constantly playing games and watching anime without caring about what happens to my life. I never ended up growing as a person.<br><br>

        Now that my friends have gotten inactive, I feel like this is the best opportunity for me to leave without feeling guilty about leaving people. I feel less inclined to actually talk in the friend group, so I feel less guilty making this decision too.<br><br>

        I might regret this decision, it's likely I'll feel extremely lonely after leaving, but in the first place I've already handled myself well without friends before I met everyone on Discord. I'm sure I'll get used to it, I hope. In the meanwhile, I'll probably work on trying to make friends in real life once I get an opportunity.<br><br>

        Setting aside my addictions, I've been too emotionally attached with this group anyway. I've been too obsessed with thinking about whether my friends like me or not, or if they find me annoying in any way, which has also been affecting my focus on studies. There are also certain people in this group that I've been feeling especially more and more distant over time, and how they probably don't think of me as an important friend. I just don't feel that sense of closeness anymore.<br><br>

        I mentioned being lonely after leaving, but I don't think I can actually handle that at all, so maybe if there's at least one of you out there who still want to talk to me even after I left, then I'll link some of my socials just for this. Alternatively, you could talk to me on Steam too, I'll still play games occasionally, but I doubt I'll be online there most of the time either. I'll talk to you whenever I feel lonely. At least I'll know if someone out there really cares about me and are really willing to talk to me.<br><br>

        Anyway that's all I have to say, I'm sorry again for making such a sudden decision.<br><br>
