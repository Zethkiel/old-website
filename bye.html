        Hi there, to whoever is reading this. Sorry if I'm making such a statement so suddenly, but I plan on leaving
        Discord for good. I can't say for sure if it's *permanent*, but I'm not going back until the far future.<br><br>

        I noticed that I've recently developed an unhealthy emotional attachment to this group, my obsession over time
        has been affecting my school. Every second I always end up finding myself browsing Discord instead of doing more
        important tasks, and it's been really affecting my productivity. I am constantly obsessed with chatting online,
        constantly obsessed with what my friends think of me as well, whether or not they enjoy talking to me or if they
        find me annoying. I constantly try to overthink what I can do to make them like me, so I end up wasting hours of
        my time chatting instead of doing schoolwork.<br><br>

        This is the same with games as well. I've already worked on my anime obsession and I'm not as addicted to it
        anymore like I used to, but I still find myself going back to gaming for hours and hours before I realized how
        much time I've wasted.<br><br>

        I've already tried taking a break from Discord for at least a month, but to be honest, I was actually still
        checking messages while I was invisible. I never really took a proper break from it. I could try it again, but
        I don't want the same cycle to happen again, I'll just end up secretly checking messages in fear of missing out.
        I thought the only way for me to break that urge is to probably delete all my Discord accounts that are in my
        friends' servers.<br><br>

        Now I'm still contemplating on whether or not I should delete my account. Alternatively, I could always just
        leave the servers so I could potentially come back.<br><br>

        Aside from my addictions, I have noticed most of my friends are actually progressing in life. Meanwhile, I'm
        still here pointlessly browsing Discord for messages for hours. I feel extremely left out, the fact that I'm the
        only one stuck in time here. I'm the only one who hasn't changed at all, because I'm not good at anything
        at all. With how inactive the group is, I've only just realized how lonely it feels like to not have someone to
        talk to.<br><br>

        I don't regret meeting this group. In fact, I don't think my personality would've changed for the better if not
        for this group, and I'm very thankful for that. But I kind of regret that my first genuine connection with people
        was through online, now I always feel like I'm missing out on the endless possibilities I could do with IRL
        friends.<br><br>
        
        Every single one of my IRL friends always treated me like shit. They all treated me like a weird child needing of
        protection, and that made me extremely insecure about my abilities. I ended up escaping through online, thinking
        maybe I could find people I will genuinely love there. I did, but it just wasn't enough for me. Just sending
        funny memes online isn't enough, I'll need physical interaction at some point, or it'll affect my future as well.
        As much as I love these people, I've never met them yet. I don't even know what most of them look like. I could
        never really know what kind of person am I even talking to through the screen, because I can only really see the
        surface.<br><br>

        For now I want to focus on doing something more fulfilling, so that maybe I'll feel better about myself. There
        are stuff I do genuinely want to achieve as well, so for now I want to focus on just that.<br><br>

        I really don't want to completely cut off contact, so I'll be linking my email below if ever that you really do
        still want to talk to me. Alternatively, you could probably talk to me in another social media platform that you
        have me added on, like Steam or AniList, but I can't guarantee that I'll be online there at all.<br><br>

        Sorry again if this was too sudden, bye. I'll come back some time, if I ever feel like it.
