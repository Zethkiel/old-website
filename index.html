				<div>
					Hello there! I'm Zeth, and I'm a 16 year old SHS Student.
					My pronouns are he/him.
					I usually play video games or watch anime on my free time.
					Apart from my boring ass hobbies,
					I have a bit of knowledge with programming since I've been studying recently (CS being my future course).
					I am currently starting to learn JavaScript.
					I aim to be able to turn this into a future career of mine,
					because I've been really enjoying coding as a hobby lately.
				</div>
				</br>
				<div>
					A bit more personal info about myself, I don't generally socialize with a lot of people except for a few close friends of mine,
					it's mainly because of past experiences that I don't tend to involve myself with a lot of people.
					I can be very extroverted though when it comes to my close friends :),
					so don't think of me as some kind of depressed emo guy who's unapproachable... LOL.
					I'm very open to making new friends even if I'm a bit awkward with strangers,
					so feel free to add me in Discord or any other social media if you wanna talk or something.
