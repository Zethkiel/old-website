					Welcome to my profile!
					I'm Zeth, and I'm an SHS student.
					I spend most of my time either learning coding or watching anime,
					sometimes I play games as well but not a lot anymore (played a lot before).
					I've been learning a lot of coding recently and I'm really enjoying it so far,
					currently learning JavaScript as of now. I aspire to turn this into a future
					career of mine.
					<br><br>
					I tend to prefer more quick and fast paced stuff with both games and anime, since I have very bad attention span ðŸ˜‚.
					Although there are still exceptions like Terraria (game) or Steins;Gate (anime) which are more slow paced,
					but I still love them so much.
					Sometimes I read books and LNs to get myself more used to "taking my time" with stuff,
					rather than quick and immediate enjoyment. Some of the LNs I really like are Classroom of the Elite
					(I hate the anime btw) and Monogatari.
					<br><br>
					Although I am very socially awkward and introverted towards strangers,
					I tend to get really extroverted when it comes to my friends that I feel
					comfortable talking to. I'm very open to making new friends anytime,
					so feel free to add me on Discord and have a little chat. The only platform I chat on is Discord,
					and I don't tend to accept random friend requests because of bots, so it's better to talk to me via
					email instead.
