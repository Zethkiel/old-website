                    <p>
                        1. <strong>Bocchi the Rock!</strong><br>
                        - Just as I was starting to get bored of anime recently,
                        Bocchi the Rock just instantly pulls me back in to the rabbit hole.
                        Every episode just stays consistent and even keeps getting better.<br><br>

                        Words just aren't enough for me to express my love for this show.
                        It's truly been so long since I've genuinely looked forward to the next episode everyday,
                        especially when it comes to seasonals.
                        While I really love most of the anime airing this season (Mob Psycho 100 III and Chainsaw Man
                        are some of my favorites this season), something about Bocchi the Rock just makes me
                        unconsciously think about what the next episode may offer.<br><br>

                        While the main theme presented here is pretty simple,
                        the execution feels very powerful because of Bocchi.
                        Apart from her really great character progression,
                        how they portray Bocchi's struggle to socialize is hilarious,
                        yet it still remains very relatable because of how *real* and grounded it is,
                        despite being portrayed through comedy.
                        They don't exaggerate or romanticize what social anxiety is like,
                        what you see is LITERALLY what it is.
                        Romanticizing different types of mental health disorders is a common pitfall I see with a lot of
                        "drama" anime out there (especially Your Lie in April, it's partly why I don't like YLIA that much).
                        And this is something I can really relate to,
                        so it really elevated my experience with this show.<br><br>

                        I LOVE every single character in this show.
                        I don't think there was ever a time I had to dislike some characters.
                        Every single one of them has their own unique traits and are very entertaining to watch.
                        A lot of them gets some notable characterization and development even if it's minor.<br><br>

                        And the animation is SOOOO FUCKING CLEAN WTF.
                        The overall production is just fucking insane,
                        I'm wondering why CloverWorks just couldn't be this consistent from their past anime.
                        They really took their time adding the most subtle details and it pays off wonderfully.
                        I really like how they're giving each character their own solo songs that you can actually listen to.
                        It really reminds me of KyoAni's passion for K-On,
                        I'm really glad that there are still studios that put this much effort into anime these days.<br><br>

                        It's pretty much sealed at this point,
                        Bocchi immediately takes the spot as my favorite anime now.
                        While I do constantly replace my favorites due to recency bias,
                        I don't think this is the case anymore with this anime.
                        I am thankful to this show for keeping me motivated and happy this season.

                        2. <strong>Steins;Gate</strong><br>
                        - Finding something as complex AND cohesive as Steins;Gate is extremely rare nowadays.
                        Every single moment building up to the climax always feels so meaningful and full of purpose.<br><br>

                        Time travel is such a delicate concept to deal with, both in narrative and logic.
                        It's so easy to make a mistake that could lead to a major plot hole,
                        yet Steins;Gate managed to impress me in so many ways with its complexity.
                        Despite being so complex, this show manages to convey all of this information so effectively.
                        Time travel is hard to understand for the average normie, but that doesn't matter.
                        The way the plot is structured makes it easy to understand what is going on with the show
                        without having to explain the underlying sci-fi concepts this anime uses.<br><br>

                        The worldbuilding is pretty much what sets this show apart from most time travel stories.
                        The time travel rules feels very grounded and restricted,
                        yet it doesn't contradict itself throughout the whole series.
                        Time travel here isn't just some kind of asspull here where you can immediately save the world,
                        there's real consequences that strictly follow the rules set up in this series.
                        I will not elaborate upon these consequences, because they are best known as a plot twist
                        for the show which really elevates the experience watching Steins;Gate.<br><br>

                        Setting aside the time travel itself, while the side characters aren't really made to be complex,
                        the idea of making each side character send a D-mail for their own personal reasons is already
                        enough depth to make the characters as memorable as they are now. This is probably the single edge
                        that makes this show a *tiny* bit lower than Bocchi the Rock in the rankings,
                        mainly because of how much I could connect with Bocchi's characters.
                        Nonetheless, the characters' personalities are big enough to account for this one missing element
                        that doesn't really matter to the show at all, being primarily focused on Okabe Rintarou's
                        character development, as well as being mainly a plot-driven story.<br><br>

                        Now the plot twists, just HOLY SHIT man. This is easily the best part of the show.
                        The show is harsh with its surprises and shoves it into your face the least you expect it.
                        The first half of the show really helps elevate some of the biggest reveals in this show,
                        especially when they really take their time setting up the foundations and foreshadowing
                        for the upcoming events. Having it be temporarily a slice-of-life anime for the first half
                        feels very enjoyable because the characters are very entertaining to watch,
                        especially Okabe and Kurisu's banter.<br><br>

                        I have so much to talk about Steins;Gate, but unfortunately I want to make this review as
                        cohesive as possible, only leaving out my most important thoughts about this show.
                        Fundamentally, this is easily the BEST anime I've ever seen. The story, world-building, pacing,
                        sci-fi concepts, are all incredibly well done and makes the show very satisfying to watch.
                        It's hard to convey my love for this show with just a few paragraphs,
                        but Steins;Gate is always something I can easily look back to anytime and holds a special place
                        in my heart. I will never grow tired of rewatching this anime.

                        3. <strong>Hunter x Hunter (2011)</strong><br>
                        - As someone who is generally not a fan of battle shounen anime, Hunter x Hunter genuinely
                        impressed me with how unique and innovative its ideas are.<br><br>

                        HxH loves to play with variety. There's a LOT of genre and tonal shifts from arc to arc which
                        sometimes makes you question if you're even still watching a shounen anime. At first, you get a
                        completely normal shounen anime with shounen exams (in this case, it's a hunter exam), then
                        later on it turns into a dark thriller with mafias and shit, then after that we're back to a
                        lighthearted arc involving video games. But the thing with these tonal  shifts is that, it's not
                        sudden. The anime can be as dark as it wants to be, but they still maintain the typical shounen
                        vibe you see with other long-running shounen anime. It doesn't go over the line with its dark
                        concepts that they like to show as a surprise to the viewers.<br><br>

                        Speaking of variety, it's not just the overall tone of the series that likes to play with
                        variety. Hunter x Hunter's Nen is quite possibly the most creative power system I've seen in
                        a shounen anime. It's very grounded with its established rules, and relies more on a character's
                        personality rather than through bursts of emotion that could instantly make you powerful. This
                        is the kind of common pitfall I see with a lot of shounen anime, there's always too much freedom
                        with the power levels which could end up being way too convenient for the plot.<br><br>

                        Dragon Ball is probably the best example for this. Literally every time a character rages, you
                        get a completely random and undeserved powerup, or an asspull in other words.Meanwhile in
                        Hunter x Hunter, they literally explain everything without being confusing to understand.
                        [A bit of a spoiler alert]
                        Now Kurapika's power may seem overpowered against an enemy like the Phantom Troupe, it makes
                        sense because Kurapika has his own restrictions and sacrifices that makes him so goddamn
                        powerful. But at the same time, it's still a representation of Kurapika's determination and his
                        rage towards the Phantom Troupe, but in a way that makes logical sense rather through a burst
                        of emotion coming from his rage.<br><br>

                        This is exactly what makes Hunter x Hunter's characters one of the best I've seen. Their power
                        completely represents what they are and is able to flesh them out so effectively. There's such
                        a vast amount of characters, yet they're so diverse and distinct from one another.

                    <img src="https://media.tenor.com/lTn_Gj0ljzYAAAAd/jett-valorant.gif">
                    <p>
                        1. <strong>VALORANT</strong><br>
                        - It's an odd feeling coming from someone who used to partially hate the game,
                        mainly because I never actually played it myself. Being mainly a CS:GO player,
                        I really disliked how this game looked like from the outside because of all
                        the absurd abilities that seemed to really imbalance the overall format of the game.
                        Now this game has pretty much found its way to my number 1 very easily the moment I
                        started playing it.<br><br>

                        I really love the diversity in its agents and how they allow for a lot of new
                        and unique plays. While I find the idea to be very unbalanced for the type of
                        game it is, I think the enjoyment factor just nailed it for me here no matter
                        how unbalanced it may be. If you were to compare the agents to CS:GO's nades
                        and utilities, CS:GO just pales in comparison right now if you consider the fact
                        that it still has the same old gameplay since CS 1.6. Sure, there's changes with
                        movement and the nades, but the base game is still the same ever since its release
                        with no other unique stuff added to spice up the gameplay.<br><br>

                        With the current state of CS:GO, VALORANT is just easily the better game at
                        this point. Valve doesn't really put much care into CS:GO anymore and it's
                        no longer the main focus, and the community is almost dying (NA is pretty
                        much dead in CS now LMFAO). Despite all my criticism for CS:GO, it still
                        holds a special place in my heart for being THE first game to truly introduce
                        me to the FPS genre.<br><br>

                        Btw I main KAY/O, I just love how similar that agent is to pure CS:GO.

                        2. <strong>Terraria</strong><br>
                        - OH MAN! I gotta say, this is definitely the most fun I've ever had playing an
                        adventure game. Comparing Terraria to Minecraft is honestly such a joke, even if
                        both games are mostly very different. Everything from the exploration, RPG-like
                        mechanics, combat, bosses, etc. It's just so fucking awesome to play tbh.<br><br>

                        Now I'll even go as far as to say this would've certainly be tied with VALORANT
                        for my number 1 spot, the only thing holding me back from doing so has something
                        to do with the final segments of hardmode, but for now let's get to the positives
                        first before the negatives.<br><br>

                        I think the biggest reason why I love this game so much has to do with its variety
                        for pretty much most of the game mechanics from the weapons to equipment to
                        monsters/bossfights, it gives me a lot of chances to just mess around and try out
                        new things and I'd almost never get bored of the game. Now the grinding may seem
                        tedious, but it feels very rewarding and fulfilling to be able to reach certain
                        goals in this game no matter how long it takes to grind it. And the bosses? GOD
                        that is just some of the best experiences I've had in this game, and maybe sort
                        of frustrating too because of how bad I am at this game LOL.<br><br>

                        Despite all my praise for this game, I've mentioned before that this game falls
                        off a bit nearing the final segment of the game. I gotta be honest, my favorite
                        part of this game HAS to be pre-hardmode. I just love the slower pace of the earlier
                        parts of the game and how I get to take my time progressing and just overall having
                        fun, but the more later parts of the game feels a bit to stressful to actually even
                        enjoy it properly.<br><br>

                        Things like having to deal with the corruption/crimson spread and
                        the insanely faster pace of the later parts of the game is pretty boring to me.
                        I HATE the corruption spread honestly, all it does is grief your world for no reason
                        and cleansing it doesn't even feel fulfilling because of how tedious the process is, and
                        the fact that I don't even get some kind of special reward for cleansing all of the
                        corruption is just so disappointing tbh.<br><br>

                        Now despite all of that criticism, Terraria is just a fundamentally better game than
                        VALORANT in every way, it's just that it kind of falls off to me in the more later parts
                        of the game. Terraria still deserves all my praise and is easily the most fun I've
                        ever had playing a videogame.

                        3. <strong>Team Fortress 2</strong><br>
                        - The silliest and probably the funniest game I've ever played. As of now, I no longer
                        play this game often since long ago because the devs has pretty much abandoned this game,
                        so over time I grew bored of it because there was nothing new to experience anymore,
                        although I come back to it from time to time whenever I'm bored. Nonetheless, this game
                        still stands as my 3rd favorite game until now for many reasons.<br><br>

                        All 9 classes are extremely unique and fun to play with. While some of them may be a bit
                        OP, pretty much all of them have their own disadvantages and it really just depends on
                        your own playstyle. Also, TF2 is just a casual game to have fun with anyway, who cares
                        about unbalanced classes? The different types of weapons you can use to customize your
                        loadout just makes the overall experience feel a lot more unique.
