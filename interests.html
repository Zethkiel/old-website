                        1. VALORANT<br>
                        - It's an odd feeling coming from someone who used to partially hate the game,
                        mainly because I never actually played it myself. Being mainly a CS:GO player,
                        I really disliked how this game looked like from the outside because of all
                        the absurd abilities that seemed to really imbalance the overall format of the game.
                        Now this game has pretty much found its way to my number 1 very easily the moment I
                        started playing it.<br><br>

                        I really love the diversity in its agents and how they allow for a lot of new
                        and unique plays. While I find the idea to be very unbalanced for the type of
                        game it is, I think the enjoyment factor just nailed it for me here no matter
                        how unbalanced it may be. If you were to compare the agents to CS:GO's nades
                        and utilities, CS:GO just pales in comparison right now if you consider the fact
                        that it still has the same old gameplay since CS 1.6. Sure, there's changes with
                        movement and the nades, but the base game is still the same ever since its release
                        with no other unique stuff added to spice up the gameplay.<br><br>

                        With the current state of CS:GO, VALORANT is just easily the better game at
                        this point. Valve doesn't really put much care into CS:GO anymore and it's
                        no longer the main focus, and the community is almost dying (NA is pretty
                        much dead in CS now LMFAO). Despite all my criticism for CS:GO, it still
                        holds a special place in my heart for being THE first game to truly introduce
                        me to the FPS genre.
