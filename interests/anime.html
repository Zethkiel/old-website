                        1. <strong>Bocchi the Rock!</strong><br>
                        - Yes, my favorite anime is a cute girls anime. Fight me.<br><br>

                        Jokes aside, it's been a while since I've had a new favorite anime since Steins;Gate,
                        considering recent anime these days aren't usually that good.<br><br>

                        Calling Bocchi the Rock! as simply another SOL anime is a crime, because when you consider how
                        badly the anime industry is going as of recently, you'll realize how rare it is for a passion
                        project like Bocchi to exist. It is an adaptation full of heart and soul by talented animators.
                        While in essence, it doesn't seem distinguishable enough compared to other SOL anime out there,
                        the comedy and character development in Bocchi shouldn't be disregarded.<br><br>

                        Comparing Bocchi to an actual SOL like K-On! is pretty bad anyway. Bocchi looks like another SOL
                        anime, but it's really more than that. Shows like K-On! are successful more so for its relaxing
                        moments, which is what an SOL anime should be. However, what separates Bocchi from other SOL
                        anime for me is its comedy. While the gags themselves are quite simple compared to the likes of
                        Gintama or Kaguya-sama, the amount of effort CloverWorks put into its visual creativity is what
                        makes this show so funny in the first place.<br><br>

                        The gags themselves are great, but the visual creativity is just the icing on the cake here.
                        When I tried reading the manga, I can't help but notice how lifeless it felt like, even if I
                        still did enjoy it for what it is. It just doesn't feel the same as the adaptation at all,
                        especially since it's in 4-koma format.<br><br>

                        While the main appeal of the show is its comedy, what truly made this show a masterpiece to me
                        is how heartfelt and genuine the characters are. Maybe it's just my escapist nature wanting such
                        close friends like these in real life. However, there is one character that I just can't help but praise
                        so much. Believe it or not, it's not actually Bocchi herself (although I do certainly love her
                        so much too).<br><br>

                        My favorite character from this show, is Nijika Ijichi. Nijika in general isn't a very
                        distinguishable character, especially when you compare her to the rest of the girls who each
                        always have some sort of interesting or unique trait to them, like Ryo's funny introverted
                        nature, or Kita's weird obsession. Nijika is relatively normal in comparison to the rest. She's
                        had some funny moments too, but you can't deny that she's certainly the most "normal" from the
                        band.<br><br>

                        What sets her apart from the rest of the girls for me isn't her personality, but rather her
                        character writing. Nijika, for me, is the heart and soul of Kessoku Band, and the band wouldn't
                        be standing on where it is right now without her. What I love most about her, is how much she
                        helps and understand Bocchi with her character development. She's extroverted, but she's never
                        too pushy towards Bocchi to the point that it becomes toxic. There's enough balance so that
                        Bocchi will be able to take a step forward.<br><br>

                        I find that those kinds of friends are what I desire the most. Although it's probably just my
                        escapist nature showing again, I can't help but think of how genuine Nijika is as a character,
                        and how believable she is too.<br><br>

                        I also mentioned something about Bocchi's character development, and it's also one of the
                        reasons why I think this show is different from the usual feel-good SOL anime: there is ACTUALLY
                        SOME MEANINGFUL PLOT PROGRESSION, and a good one at that too. Bocchi's character development
                        isn't anything complex, but one thing I know for sure is that it's genuine and relatable for me
                        personally.<br><br>

                        Lastly, although it's not the most important, the music in this show is the PERFECT icing on the
                        cake. I mean, it's a freaking music anime, so they gotta make sure they get the music itself done
                        well, right? Surprisingly with Bocchi, it's more than just done well, it's fucking fantastic.
                        This is another point where you truly start to notice how much effort is put into producing this
                        anime, because they actually care about the soundtrack especially as a music anime. At some
                        point, it makes me realize how unrealistic it is. I mean, Kessoku Band is a freaking high school
                        girl band, yet their songs slap so hard. But who cares if it's unrealistic? As long as the songs
                        slap, I'm all in.<br><br>

                        Bocchi will wholeheartedly be one of my favorite anime forever, and it will maybe even stay in
                        my top 1 for even longer too. I mean, it took a year for me to find something to replace
                        Steins;Gate, so I'm not even surprised if Bocchi stays up there for longer. I am genuinely sad
                        that this show has ended, but I'm very thankful for this show for the endless amount of joy I
                        get from watching this. Thank you, Bocchi.

                        2. <strong>Steins;Gate</strong>
                        - Finding something as complex AND cohesive as Steins;Gate is  extremely rare nowadays.
                        Every single moment building up to the climax always feels so meaningful and full of purpose.<br><br>

                        Time travel, as simple and common it sounds like, is generally always a flawed and delicate
                        concept/plot device to deal with, due to the amount of plot holes you could generate. However,
                        Steins;Gate is one of the few that executes this almost perfectly due to well-structured and
                        complex world-building.<br><br>

                        Normally, something like this would feel off-putting for normies who don't really understand
                        sci-fi, but that doesn't even matter. The way the plot is structured makes it really easy to
                        understand the show without needing knowledge of the underlying sci-fi concepts this anime uses.<br><br>

                        The time travel rules feel grounded and restricted, yet it doesn't contradict itself throughout
                        the whole series. There are real consequences that strictly follow the rules that have been set
                        up for this show, which really negates the argument of time travel being primarily an "asspull".<br><br>

                        The side characters aren't made to be complex being primarily a plot-driven show, but making the
                        characters send their own personal D-mails is already enough depth to make you care for them.
                        Some of their character dynamic is honestly really amazing and entertaining enough to really
                        make you connect with the characters on an emotional level, even if most of them lack character
                        development.<br><br>

                        Finally, the plot twists. This is EASILY my favorite aspect of this show and is exactly why I
                        couldn't stop watching this the first time. The show is harsh with its surprises and shoves it
                        into your face the least you expect it, it always keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering
                        what the next episode may offer.<br><br>

                        To conclude, Steins;Gate is a one-of-a-kind anime to me, and I don't think any anime could
                        ever replace my love for this show, at least not until in the far future. The story,
                        world-building, pacing, and sci-fi concepts are all incredibly well done and makes the show very
                        satisfying to watch. It's hard to convey my love for this show with just a few paragraphs, but
                        Steins;Gate is always something I can easily look back to anytime and holds a special place in
                        my heart.

                        3. <strong>The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya</strong><br>
                        - To be frank, I don't consider myself to be a big fan of the whole Haruhi franchise. However,
                        after being greeted by this movie, I now find myself praising this as a masterpiece, completely
                        shoving all of my negative thoughts about the whole show.<br><br>

                        As the movie takes its time introducing the new world, some people may find the prologue to be a
                        bit slow and boring to watch, after all a whole quarter of the movie is just Kyon doing the most
                        embarrassing shit (though natural). However, I see this more as a careful representation of how
                        the new world looks like, which can help you understand more of the movie's major themes later
                        on and how this greatly affects character development.<br><br>

                        The most notable aspect of the movie is its plot twists, especially with how well these revolve
                        around events and character motives from the original series. A lot of past scenes mainly played
                        for comedy are stuff that you wouldn't expect to play a major role in concluding the mysteries
                        of this movie, which adds a lot more to its unpredictable nature.<br><br>

                        One of my main gripes from the original series is how repetitive its troupey characters tend to
                        be. With very little to no development at all, a lot of its comedic scenes only start to become
                        stale the more you watch the series. The movie greatly fixes this by giving its characters the
                        development they needed. With past events playing a major role in the story, a lot of them
                        heavily influences the characters' major development.<br><br>

                        While the movie mostly focuses on developing Kyon, I feel like not a lot of people tend to
                        mention Yuki Nagato's importance to the story. Someone who used to be an emotionless and robotic
                        plot device now feels like an actual human who serves a major purpose at greatly portraying one
                        of the movie's underlying themes and messages. I'm trying to be as vague as I can to avoid
                        spoilers, but trust me, you'll get a lot of emotional attachment to her with the huge change of
                        her character writing.<br><br>

                        To conclude this review while trying to avoid spoilers, this movie in my opinion takes character
                        development to a whole new level and is almost nothing like how the original series was. The
                        mysteries started to become compelling, the characters have become more believable and
                        relatable, and the story has now leaned towards a more dramatic tone. If you didn't like the
                        original series, I still think it's worth giving this movie a try as it fixes a lot of what was
                        missing in the Haruhi franchise.<br><br>

                        Before you get your expectations too high for this anime, just a caution that if you think your
                        previous questions about the TV show's plot will get answered this movie, throw out that
                        expectation out the window. This movie is NOT a grand follow-up to the TV series, this movie is
                        self-contained and also completely different from the usual atmosphere of the Haruhi series.

                        1. <strong>Hunter x Hunter (2011)</strong><br>
                        - As someone who is generally not a fan of battle shounen anime, Hunter x Hunter genuinely
                        impressed me with how unique and innovative its ideas are.<br><br>

                        HxH loves to play with variety. There's a LOT of genre and tonal shifts from arc to arc which
                        sometimes makes you question if you're even still watching a shounen anime. At first, you get a
                        completely normal shounen anime with shounen exams (in this case, it's a hunter exam), then
                        later on it turns into a dark thriller with mafias and shit, then after that we're back to a
                        lighthearted arc involving video games. But the thing with these tonal  shifts is that, it's not
                        sudden. The anime can be as dark as it wants to be, but they still maintain the typical shounen
                        vibe you see with other long-running shounen anime. It doesn't go over the line with its dark
                        concepts that they like to show as a surprise to the viewers.<br><br>

                        Speaking of variety, it's not just the overall tone of the series that likes to play with
                        variety. Hunter x Hunter's Nen is quite possibly the most creative power system I've seen in
                        a shounen anime. It's very grounded with its established rules, and relies more on a character's
                        personality rather than through bursts of emotion that could instantly make you powerful. This
                        is the kind of common pitfall I see with a lot of shounen anime, there's always too much freedom
                        with the power levels which could end up being way too convenient for the plot.<br><br>

                        Dragon Ball is probably the best example for this. Literally every time a character rages, you
                        get a completely random and undeserved powerup, or an asspull in other words.Meanwhile in
                        Hunter x Hunter, they literally explain everything without being confusing to understand.
                        [A bit of a spoiler alert]
                        Now Kurapika's power may seem overpowered against an enemy like the Phantom Troupe, it makes
                        sense because Kurapika has his own restrictions and sacrifices that makes him so goddamn
                        powerful. But at the same time, it's still a representation of Kurapika's determination and his
                        rage towards the Phantom Troupe, but in a way that makes logical sense rather than through a
                        burst of emotion coming from his rage.<br><br>

                        This is exactly what makes Hunter x Hunter's characters one of the best I've seen. Their power
                        completely represents what they are and is able to flesh them out so effectively. There's such
                        a vast amount of characters, yet they're so diverse and distinct from one another.<br><br>

                        To conclude, Hunter x Hunter has one of the best and most diverse characters I've seen. Every
                        episode always stays consistent despite being a long-running anime, except for a few pacing
                        issues during the Chimera Ant arc. Comparing Hunter x Hunter to your usual shounen is a complete
                        joke. This anime isn't Naruto, there's a lot more to it than what meets the eye.

                        2. <strong>Puella Magi Madoka Magica</strong><br>
                        - [SPOILER ALERT, it's hard to analyze this anime without going into spoiler territory.]
                        Don't be fooled by the kiddy looking banner, this is NOT a kid friendly magical girl anime.<br><br>

                        Madoka Magica is a traumatizing, yet deep and profound thematic experience. In contrast to the
                        typical magical girl anime full of hope and joy, Madoka Magica presents themes of hopelessness
                        and despair in comparison, which is why this anime works perfectly well subverting magical girl
                        tropes.<br><br>

                        If you are aware of Urobuchi's common writing style, then what happens in this show is to be
                        expected. It's extremely harsh with its characters and does not give them a single glimmer of
                        hope, but at the same time it still manages to avoid being too edgy for the sake of it, because
                        each and every character always plays a certain role in what the show is trying to convey.<br><br>

                        Setting aside the story, this anime literally has Shaft's fingerprints all over it. Weird yet
                        amazing visual creavity that greatly contributes to the overall themes of the show. The show's
                        glaringly weird artstyle will initially seem off-putting, but it really helps set up the creepy
                        atmosphere throughout the series.<br><br>

                        The OST in this anime is the BEST I've seen, especially when it's composed by Yuki Kajiura. Its
                        incredibly atmospheric and haunting melody really enhances the show on top of Shaft's visual
                        creativity to provide the best creepy atmosphere I've ever seen.<br><br>

                        Overall, this is the BEST directed anime I've ever seen. Shaft's weird yet masterful visuals as
                        well as Yuki Kajiura's haunting tunes really enhances the overall experience, which makes this
                        stand out as the most traumatizing anime for me personally.
