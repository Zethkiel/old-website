                        <strong>1. Steins;Gate</strong>
                        - Finding something as complex AND cohesive as Steins;Gate is  extremely rare nowadays.
                        Every single moment building up to the climax always feels so meaningful and full of purpose.<br><br>

                        Time travel, as simple and common it sounds like, is generally always a flawed and delicate
                        concept/plot device to deal with, due to the amount of plot holes you could generate. However,
                        Steins;Gate is one of the few that executes this almost perfectly due to well-structured and
                        complex world-building.<br><br>

                        Normally, something like this would feel off-putting for normies who don't really understand
                        sci-fi, but that doesn't even matter. The way the plot is structured makes it really easy to
                        understand the show without needing knowledge of the underlying sci-fi concepts this anime uses.<br><br>

                        The time travel rules feel grounded and restricted, yet it doesn't contradict itself throughout
                        the whole series. There are real consequences that strictly follow the rules that have been set
                        up for this show, which really negates the argument of time travel being primarily an "asspull".<br><br>

                        The side characters aren't made to be complex being primarily a plot-driven show, but making the
                        characters send their own personal D-mails is already enough depth to make you care for them.
                        Some of their character dynamic is honestly really amazing and entertaining enough to really
                        make you connect with the characters on an emotional level, even if most of them lack character
                        development.<br><br>

                        Finally, the plot twists. This is EASILY my favorite aspect of this show and is exactly why I
                        couldn't stop watching this the first time. The show is harsh with its surprises and shoves it
                        into your face the least you expect it, it always keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering
                        what the next episode may offer.<br><br>

                        To conclude, Steins;Gate is my favorite anime of all-time, and I don't think any anime could
                        ever replace my love for this show, at least not until in the far future. The story,
                        world-building, pacing, and sci-fi concepts are all incredibly well done and makes the show very
                        satisfying to watch. It's hard to convey my love for this show with just a few paragraphs, but
                        Steins;Gate is always something I can easily look back to anytime and holds a special place in
                        my heart.

                        2. <strong>The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya</strong><br>
                        - To be frank, I don't consider myself to be a big fan of the whole Haruhi franchise. However,
                        after being greeted by this movie, I now find myself praising this as a masterpiece, completely
                        shoving all of my negative thoughts about the whole show.<br><br>

                        As the movie takes its time introducing the new world, some people may find the prologue to be a
                        bit slow and boring to watch, after all a whole quarter of the movie is just Kyon doing the most
                        embarrassing shit (though natural). However, I see this more as a careful representation of how
                        the new world looks like, which can help you understand more of the movie's major themes later
                        on and how this greatly affects character development.<br><br>

                        The most notable aspect of the movie is its plot twists, especially with how well these revolve
                        around events and character motives from the original series. A lot of past scenes mainly played
                        for comedy are stuff that you wouldn't expect to play a major role in concluding the mysteries
                        of this movie, which adds a lot more to its unpredictable nature.<br><br>

                        One of my main gripes from the original series is how repetitive its troupey characters tend to
                        be. With very little to no development at all, a lot of its comedic scenes only start to become
                        stale the more you watch the series. The movie greatly fixes this by giving its characters the
                        development they needed. With past events playing a major role in the story, a lot of them
                        heavily influences the characters' major development.<br><br>

                        While the movie mostly focuses on developing Kyon, I feel like not a lot of people tend to
                        mention Yuki Nagato's importance to the story. Someone who used to be an emotionless and robotic
                        plot device now feels like an actual human who serves a major purpose at greatly portraying one
                        of the movie's underlying themes and messages. I'm trying to be as vague as I can to avoid
                        spoilers, but trust me, you'll get a lot of emotional attachment to her with the huge change of
                        her character writing.<br><br>

                        To conclude this review while trying to avoid spoilers, this movie in my opinion takes character
                        development to a whole new level and is almost nothing like how the original series was. The
                        mysteries started to become compelling, the characters have become more believable and
                        relatable, and the story has now leaned towards a more dramatic tone. If you didn't like the
                        original series, I still think it's worth giving this movie a try as it fixes a lot of what was
                        missing in the Haruhi franchise.<br><br>

                        Before you get your expectations too high for this anime, just a caution that if you think your
                        previous questions about the TV show's plot will get answered this movie, throw out that
                        expectation out the window. This movie is NOT a grand follow-up to the TV series, this movie is
                        self-contained and also completely different from the usual atmosphere of the Haruhi series.

                        3. <strong>Bocchi the Rock!</strong><br>
                        - Just as I was starting to get bored of anime recently,
                        Bocchi the Rock just instantly pulls me back in to the rabbit hole.
                        Every episode just stays consistent and even keeps getting better.<br><br>

                        Words just aren't enough for me to express my love for this show.
                        It's truly been so long since I've genuinely looked forward to the next episode everyday,
                        especially when it comes to seasonals.
                        While I really love most of the anime airing this season (Mob Psycho 100 III and Chainsaw Man
                        are some of my favorites this season), something about Bocchi the Rock just makes me
                        unconsciously think about what the next episode may offer.<br><br>

                        While the main theme presented here is pretty simple,
                        the execution feels very powerful because of Bocchi.
                        Apart from her really great character progression,
                        how they portray Bocchi's struggle to socialize is hilarious,
                        yet it still remains very relatable because of how *real* and grounded it is,
                        despite being portrayed through comedy.
                        They don't exaggerate or romanticize what social anxiety is like,
                        what you see is LITERALLY what it is.
                        Romanticizing different types of mental health disorders is a common pitfall I see with a lot of
                        "drama" anime out there (especially Your Lie in April, it's partly why I don't like YLIA that much).
                        And this is something I can really relate to,
                        so it really elevated my experience with this show.<br><br>

                        I LOVE every single character in this show.
                        I don't think there was ever a time I had to dislike some characters.
                        Every single one of them has their own unique traits and are very entertaining to watch.
                        A lot of them gets some notable characterization and development even if it's minor.<br><br>

                        And the animation is SOOOO FUCKING CLEAN WTF.
                        The overall production is just fucking insane,
                        I'm wondering why CloverWorks just couldn't be this consistent from their past anime.
                        They really took their time adding the most subtle details and it pays off wonderfully.
                        I really like how they're giving each character their own solo songs that you can actually listen to.
                        It really reminds me of KyoAni's passion for K-On,
                        I'm really glad that there are still studios that put this much effort into anime these days.

                        1. <strong>Hunter x Hunter (2011)</strong><br>
                        - As someone who is generally not a fan of battle shounen anime, Hunter x Hunter genuinely
                        impressed me with how unique and innovative its ideas are.<br><br>

                        HxH loves to play with variety. There's a LOT of genre and tonal shifts from arc to arc which
                        sometimes makes you question if you're even still watching a shounen anime. At first, you get a
                        completely normal shounen anime with shounen exams (in this case, it's a hunter exam), then
                        later on it turns into a dark thriller with mafias and shit, then after that we're back to a
                        lighthearted arc involving video games. But the thing with these tonal  shifts is that, it's not
                        sudden. The anime can be as dark as it wants to be, but they still maintain the typical shounen
                        vibe you see with other long-running shounen anime. It doesn't go over the line with its dark
                        concepts that they like to show as a surprise to the viewers.<br><br>

                        Speaking of variety, it's not just the overall tone of the series that likes to play with
                        variety. Hunter x Hunter's Nen is quite possibly the most creative power system I've seen in
                        a shounen anime. It's very grounded with its established rules, and relies more on a character's
                        personality rather than through bursts of emotion that could instantly make you powerful. This
                        is the kind of common pitfall I see with a lot of shounen anime, there's always too much freedom
                        with the power levels which could end up being way too convenient for the plot.<br><br>

                        Dragon Ball is probably the best example for this. Literally every time a character rages, you
                        get a completely random and undeserved powerup, or an asspull in other words.Meanwhile in
                        Hunter x Hunter, they literally explain everything without being confusing to understand.
                        [A bit of a spoiler alert]
                        Now Kurapika's power may seem overpowered against an enemy like the Phantom Troupe, it makes
                        sense because Kurapika has his own restrictions and sacrifices that makes him so goddamn
                        powerful. But at the same time, it's still a representation of Kurapika's determination and his
                        rage towards the Phantom Troupe, but in a way that makes logical sense rather than through a
                        burst of emotion coming from his rage.<br><br>

                        This is exactly what makes Hunter x Hunter's characters one of the best I've seen. Their power
                        completely represents what they are and is able to flesh them out so effectively. There's such
                        a vast amount of characters, yet they're so diverse and distinct from one another.<br><br>

                        To conclude, Hunter x Hunter has one of the best and most diverse characters I've seen. Every
                        episode always stays consistent despite being a long-running anime, except for a few pacing
                        issues during the Chimera Ant arc. Comparing Hunter x Hunter to your usual shounen is a complete
                        joke. This anime isn't Naruto, there's a lot more to it than what meets the eye.

                        2. <strong>Puella Magi Madoka Magica</strong><br>
                        - [SPOILER ALERT, it's hard to analyze this anime without going into spoiler territory.]
                        Don't be fooled by the kiddy looking banner, this is NOT a kid friendly magical girl anime.<br><br>

                        Madoka Magica is a traumatizing, yet deep and profound thematic experience. In contrast to the
                        typical magical girl anime full of hope and joy, Madoka Magica presents themes of hopelessness
                        and despair in comparison, which is why this anime works perfectly well subverting magical girl
                        tropes.<br><br>

                        If you are aware of Urobuchi's common writing style, then what happens in this show is to be
                        expected. It's extremely harsh with its characters and does not give them a single glimmer of
                        hope, but at the same time it still manages to avoid being too edgy for the sake of it, because
                        each and every character always plays a certain role in what the show is trying to convey.<br><br>

                        Setting aside the story, this anime literally has Shaft's fingerprints all over it. Weird yet
                        amazing visual creavity that greatly contributes to the overall themes of the show. The show's
                        glaringly weird artstyle will initially seem off-putting, but it really helps set up the creepy
                        atmosphere throughout the series.<br><br>

                        The OST in this anime is the BEST I've seen, especially when it's composed by Yuki Kajiura. Its
                        incredibly atmospheric and haunting melody really enhances the show on top of Shaft's visual
                        creativity to provide the best creepy atmosphere I've ever seen.<br><br>

                        Overall, this is the BEST directed anime I've ever seen. Shaft's weird yet masterful visuals as
                        well as Yuki Kajiura's haunting tunes really enhances the overall experience, which makes this
                        stand out as the most traumatizing anime for me personally.
