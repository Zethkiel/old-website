                    <p><em>
                        NOTE: I will not put any anime that I've watched and rated an 8/10 or below here, it'll be a
                        mess if I included all of them considering I've watched way too much anime. Anime marked with
                        the color <span style="color: #1DB954;">green</span> are my current/ongoing interest.
                    </em></p>
                    <h1>What I love (10/10):</h1>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Bocchi the Rock</strong> - Wholeheartedly my favorite anime forever. A chaotic yet
                        extremely comforting comedy coupled with heartwarming characters. AND THE FUCKING MEMES!!!
                        Despite being mostly comedy, I can't help but relate to Bocchi. Really helped get my shit
                        together for once. I'll forever be thankful for this show.<br><br>

                        <strong>Steins;Gate</strong> - Incredibly complex, yet surprisingly accessible and easy to
                        digest. One of the few shows that get time travel right without being so convoluted, alongside
                        a great story and some of the best character dynamic I've seen from Okabe and Kurisu (my
                        favorite pair). Steins;Gate is the one anime that stood really well against the test of time,
                        it continued to be my favorite anime for a year of me watching anime before I discovered
                        Bocchi.<br><br>

                        <strong>The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya</strong> - A simplistic premise that manage to tug
                        at my heartstrings and really care about its characters. It doesn't do anything extremely
                        different compared to your usual slice-of-life, yet to call it as just another one of its kind
                        is a crime considering the amount of effort poured into its compelling mysteries and
                        characters.<br><br>

                        <strong>Oregairu Season 2</strong> - A romance drama that's easy to brush off as simply another
                        edgy high school anime with a narcissistic protagonist. It's far from it, though. It is
                        ultimately one of the anime that realistically portrays "teenager drama" really well, as well
                        as the underlying motives of society, without being extremely edgy in its premise. Hachiman is
                        one of the few protagonists I strongly sympathize with, and his character development is
                        something to learn from as he moves on from his narcissistic self and opens up to his real
                        friends about his struggles for once.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <h1>Other anime I really liked and enjoyed (9/10):</h1>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Girls' Last Tour</strong> - A melancholic and gloomy world that manages to be so
                        wholesome and comforting despite its premise. Really different compared to the usual CGDCT show
                        out there. It shows a story of two girls trying to find hope in a tragic world.<br><br>

                        <strong>Hunter x Hunter (2011)</strong> - I don't usually like long-running shounen anime,
                        considering how most of them seem to drag on way too much for me. HxH is different due to its
                        extremely compelling characters and a well-structured power system that works well to flesh out
                        each character. Its fights aren't anything "flashy" like Demon Slayer, but it's thrilling
                        because of the mind games of its compelling power system.<br><br>

                        <strong><span style="color: #1DB954;">Mushishi</span></strong> - I haven't finished it yet, but it's very
                        calming to watch without being too boring and uneventful. A great balance between tension and
                        a calming atmosphere, which is the reason why I find this anime so accessible despite my dislike
                        for iyashikei. Ginko is such a cool dude.<br><br>

                        <strong>Puella Magi Madoka Magica</strong> - A dark anime that actually manages to not be edgy!
                        It's a fantastic contrast to the usual lightheared magical girls show. Rather than a show full
                        of hope, Madoka Magica presents theme of hopelessness and despair instead, without being
                        unnecessarily edgy for the sake of it. Its darkest moments have meaning and serves a purpose
                        rather than being the typical torture porn for the sake of shock value.<br><br>

                        <strong>Gurren Lagann</strong> - Funny enough, the anime I covered just before this (Madoka
                        Magica) is an anime full of hopelessness. Then we got this anime, an anime full of hope (and
                        chadness too), like literally. It's such a fucking absurd show, but it works so well with what
                        its trying to portray. "Don’t believe in yourself. Believe in me! Believe in the Kamina who
                        believes in you!"<br><br>

                        <strong>March comes in like a lion</strong> - Quite possibly the anime I have the most
                        <em>respect</em> for, even if it's not my all-time favorite. I have so much respect for this
                        because of how much it portrays depression so well, without being very dark or hard to watch. In
                        fact, this anime is actually pretty lighthearted, yet its THE anime that depicts depression the
                        best. Not a personal fan of its slow pacing, but it works best for the show's narrative
                        approach so it's just a personal thing (more like I have bad attention span haha).<br><br>

                        <strong>Psycho-Pass (Season 1 only)</strong> - An extremely compelling sci-fi dystopian setting and concept
                        coupled with amazing and well-written characters. Makishima is one of the best antagonists I've
                        seen, and how he contradicts the Sybil system is a treat to watch.<br><br>

                        <strong>Monogatari Series</strong> - Most bizarre shit I've watched, for a good reason. It's
                        quite possibly the most unique anime I've seen with how it plays around with the visuals as a
                        unique way of storytelling, and its dialogue is some of the best I've seen. I'm not usually a
                        fan extreme walls of dialogue when it comes to anime, but Monogatari managed to make it so
                        compelling to watch. Its excessive fanservice and loli fetish are my only gripes with this
                        otherwise masterpiece-level story.<br><br>

                        -I'll put more when I have the time, I'm lazy asf lol-
