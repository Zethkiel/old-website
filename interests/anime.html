                        <strong>1. Steins;Gate</strong>
                        - Finding something as complex AND cohesive as Steins;Gate is  extremely rare nowadays.
                        Every single moment building up to the climax always feels so meaningful and full of purpose.<br><br>

                        Time travel, as simple and common it sounds like, is generally always a flawed and delicate
                        concept/plot device to deal with, due to the amount of plot holes you could generate. However,
                        Steins;Gate is one of the few that executes this almost perfectly due to well-structured and
                        complex world-building.<br><br>

                        Normally, something like this would feel off-putting for normies who don't really understand
                        sci-fi, but that doesn't even matter. The way the plot is structured makes it really easy to
                        understand the show without needing knowledge of the underlying sci-fi concepts this anime uses.<br><br>

                        The time travel rules feel grounded and restricted, yet it doesn't contradict itself throughout
                        the whole series. There are real consequences that strictly follow the rules that have been set
                        up for this show, which really negates the argument of time travel being primarily an "asspull".<br><br>

                        The side characters aren't made to be complex being primarily a plot-driven show, but making the
                        characters send their own personal D-mails is already enough depth to make you care for them.
                        Some of their character dynamic is honestly really amazing and entertaining enough to really
                        make you connect with the characters on an emotional level, even if most of them lack character
                        development.<br><br>

                        Finally, the plot twists. This is EASILY my favorite aspect of this show and is exactly why I
                        couldn't stop watching this the first time. The show is harsh with its surprises and shoves it
                        into your face the least you expect it, it always keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering
                        what the next episode may offer.<br><br>

                        To conclude, Steins;Gate is my favorite anime of all-time, and I don't think any anime could
                        ever replace my love for this show, at least not until in the far future. The story,
                        world-building, pacing, and sci-fi concepts are all incredibly well done and makes the show very
                        satisfying to watch. It's hard to convey my love for this show with just a few paragraphs, but
                        Steins;Gate is always something I can easily look back to anytime and holds a special place in
                        my heart.

                        2. <strong>The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya</strong><br>
                        - To be frank, I don't consider myself to be a big fan of the whole Haruhi franchise. However,
                        after being greeted by this movie, I now find myself praising this as a masterpiece, completely
                        shoving all of my negative thoughts about the whole show.<br><br>

                        As the movie takes its time introducing the new world, some people may find the prologue to be a
                        bit slow and boring to watch, after all a whole quarter of the movie is just Kyon doing the most
                        embarrassing shit (though natural). However, I see this more as a careful representation of how
                        the new world looks like, which can help you understand more of the movie's major themes later
                        on and how this greatly affects character development.<br><br>

                        The most notable aspect of the movie is its plot twists, especially with how well these revolve
                        around events and character motives from the original series. A lot of past scenes mainly played
                        for comedy are stuff that you wouldn't expect to play a major role in concluding the mysteries
                        of this movie, which adds a lot more to its unpredictable nature.<br><br>

                        One of my main gripes from the original series is how repetitive its troupey characters tend to
                        be. With very little to no development at all, a lot of its comedic scenes only start to become
                        stale the more you watch the series. The movie greatly fixes this by giving its characters the
                        development they needed. With past events playing a major role in the story, a lot of them
                        heavily influences the characters' major development.<br><br>

                        While the movie mostly focuses on developing Kyon, I feel like not a lot of people tend to
                        mention Yuki Nagato's importance to the story. Someone who used to be an emotionless and robotic
                        plot device now feels like an actual human who serves a major purpose at greatly portraying one
                        of the movie's underlying themes and messages. I'm trying to be as vague as I can to avoid
                        spoilers, but trust me, you'll get a lot of emotional attachment to her with the huge change of
                        her character writing.<br><br>

                        To conclude this review while trying to avoid spoilers, this movie in my opinion takes character
                        development to a whole new level and is almost nothing like how the original series was. The
                        mysteries started to become compelling, the characters have become more believable and
                        relatable, and the story has now leaned towards a more dramatic tone. If you didn't like the
                        original series, I still think it's worth giving this movie a try as it fixes a lot of what was
                        missing in the Haruhi franchise.<br><br>

                        Before you get your expectations too high for this anime, just a caution that if you think your
                        previous questions about the TV show's plot will get answered this movie, throw out that
                        expectation out the window. THis movie is NOT a grand follow-up to the TV series, this movie is
                        self-contained and also completely different from the usual atmosphere of the Haruhi series.

                        3. <strong>Hunter x Hunter (2011)</strong><br>
                        - As someone who is generally not a fan of battle shounen anime, Hunter x Hunter genuinely
                        impressed me with how unique and innovative its ideas are.<br><br>

                        HxH loves to play with variety. There's a LOT of genre and tonal shifts from arc to arc which
                        sometimes makes you question if you're even still watching a shounen anime. At first, you get a
                        completely normal shounen anime with shounen exams (in this case, it's a hunter exam), then
                        later on it turns into a dark thriller with mafias and shit, then after that we're back to a
                        lighthearted arc involving video games. But the thing with these tonal  shifts is that, it's not
                        sudden. The anime can be as dark as it wants to be, but they still maintain the typical shounen
                        vibe you see with other long-running shounen anime. It doesn't go over the line with its dark
                        concepts that they like to show as a surprise to the viewers.<br><br>

                        Speaking of variety, it's not just the overall tone of the series that likes to play with
                        variety. Hunter x Hunter's Nen is quite possibly the most creative power system I've seen in
                        a shounen anime. It's very grounded with its established rules, and relies more on a character's
                        personality rather than through bursts of emotion that could instantly make you powerful. This
                        is the kind of common pitfall I see with a lot of shounen anime, there's always too much freedom
                        with the power levels which could end up being way too convenient for the plot.<br><br>

                        Dragon Ball is probably the best example for this. Literally every time a character rages, you
                        get a completely random and undeserved powerup, or an asspull in other words.Meanwhile in
                        Hunter x Hunter, they literally explain everything without being confusing to understand.
                        [A bit of a spoiler alert]
                        Now Kurapika's power may seem overpowered against an enemy like the Phantom Troupe, it makes
                        sense because Kurapika has his own restrictions and sacrifices that makes him so goddamn
                        powerful. But at the same time, it's still a representation of Kurapika's determination and his
                        rage towards the Phantom Troupe, but in a way that makes logical sense rather than through a
                        burst of emotion coming from his rage.<br><br>

                        This is exactly what makes Hunter x Hunter's characters one of the best I've seen. Their power
                        completely represents what they are and is able to flesh them out so effectively. There's such
                        a vast amount of characters, yet they're so diverse and distinct from one another.<br><br>

                        To conclude, Hunter x Hunter has one of the best and most diverse characters I've seen. Every
                        episode always stays consistent despite being a long-running anime, except for a few pacing
                        issues during the Chimera Ant arc. Comparing Hunter x Hunter to your usual shounen is a complete
                        joke. This anime isn't Naruto, there's a lot more to it than what meets the eye.
