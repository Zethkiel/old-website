                    <h1>10/10 - Perfect</h1>
                    <p>
                        <strong>1. Terraria</strong> - My favorite game of all-time. Endlessly fun with a large variety
                        of things to experiment with. Amazing
                        exploration content, unique combat, awesome bossfights, great underlying lore, this game has
                        everything I could possibly ask for. I don't think any other game can ever top my enjoyment for
                        this one, at least not until the far future.<br><br>
                        <strong>2. Team Fortress 2</strong> - It may be half dead, but who cares? There's enough content
                        and diversity to the point that it almost never gets boring despite the lack of updates. This
                        game isn't anything competitive whatsoever, but it's strongest aspect lies in its pure chaotic
                        and goofy fun rather than something you take seriously.<br><br>

                        The slight edge that makes me put this
                        as my 2nd favorite rather than my 1st is because Valve has completely abandoned this game, thus
                        it's filled with bots and cheaters in every server you could encounter. Nonetheless, the game
                        is active enough that the bots pretty much get kicked immediately.
                    </p>
                    <h1>9.5/10 - Masterpiece</h1>
                    <p>
                        <strong>1. VALORANT</strong> - It's a strange feeling coming from a CS:GO fan who thought would
                        hate this game due to how imbalanced it looks like.<br><br>

                        I really love how much diversity the game
                        has when it comes to its agents. When comparing this to CS:GO, this game
                        easily beats it due to the amount of new content there is. I mean think about it, the
                        Counter-Strike franchise itself has had the same gameplay for 20 years now, which has me really
                        surprised considering how long that game maintained its popularity.<br><br>

                        Unfortunately, not all things can last forever, and that includes CS:GO's gameplay.<br><br>

                        <strong>2. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</strong> - The one game that manages to maintain its
                        popularity despite seemingly not changing for more than 10 years. The gameplay is so simple,
                        yet it has such a high skill ceiling that its still incredibly entertaining as an esport, with
                        a lot of pros continuing to make new and unique plays.<br><br>

                        However, like I've said before, not all
                        things can last forever. With Valve pretty much not making an effort to even keep this game
                        alive, there's pretty much 0 new content in the past few years despite continuing to release
                        new community-made maps. The whole repeating format of "new map -> learn smokes and angles ->
                        map mastered" is becoming stale and doesn't really provide anything to spice up the game anymore.<br><br>

                        I hope one day Valve takes action to save this game, otherwise I can't foresee this game lasting
                        for more than 5 years in the future.<br><br>

                        <strong>3. Portal 1</strong> - An all-time classic. It's never too late to play something as old
                        as this, because until now I still find it to be one of the most fun games ever.<br><br>

                        Its puzzles are like no other. There's always a certain challenge in one way or another without
                        being too hard or complicated even for dumb people. Games with puzzles can be really hard to get
                        into, because you'll either get bored or frustrated whenever you're stuck at a puzzle that
                        literally feels like a wall, but I never felt that in Portal 1.<br><br>

                        There's a great balance between its difficulty and accessibility, which is why this game still
                        ended up being part of mainstream despite how hard it can be to get into puzzle games. It
                        doesn't feel too punishing, and the end result is always so satisfying.<br><br>

                        If I ever had to criticize this game, it'll probably be the fact that it's too short. I am
                        always desperate for more content whenever I fall in love with any game, but unfortunately,
                        Portal 1 falls short when it comes to that aspect. Nonetheless, even if it's just 2 hours of
                        gameplay from start to finish, you will always get maximum enjoyment from this game.
                    </p>
                    <h1>9/10 - Phenomenal</h1>
                    <p>
                        <strong>1. ULTRAKILL</strong> - This game probably has the BEST singleplayer combat I've ever
                        seen. The fast-paced combat and difficulty of this game is one of my favorite aspects that
                        really keeps me consistently hyped for the next level. The bossfights feel genuinely unique and
                        really immerses you so well in the game because of how fast shit happens.<br><br>

                        Unfortunately, I tend to consider this a double edged sword. When considering the audience, the
                        game is WAY too difficult for your average gamer which really makes this game so niche compared
                        to mainstream games. The game feels too punishing and frustrating sometimes to the point that
                        I'm not always in the mood to play this.<br><br>

                        When disregarding this one flaw, this game would easily be up there in the masterpiece tier.
                        One of the most intense game I've ever played, I highly recommend it. Btw, I still haven't played
                        ACT 2 because of other priorities I have, but I plan on completing it someday.<br><br>

                        <strong>2. Portal 2</strong> - I loved Portal 1, and this game definitely lived up to my
                        expectations as well, but I can't really say it's better than its prequel.<br><br>

                        In its core, it's still Portal in a lot of ways despite some of its major changes, it's still
                        the same old Portal with cool puzzles + new concepts.<br><br>

                        The game is also longer now, and it certainly works this way because of the added narrative,
                        cool cinematics, and new puzzle concepts that are pretty fun to play around with. However, I
                        felt like the devs were trying too hard to come up with tons of variety with these new concepts,
                        and it's why some of the levels end up being very frustrating to play with. The one thing the
                        original Portal was the strongest at ended up disappearing from the 2nd game, which is the
                        balance between difficulty and accessibility.<br><br>

                        I also really missed the old atmosphere in the old Portal. Now I know Valve is trying to make
                        the game more accessible by getting rid of the creepy atmosphere, but I always feel like the
                        eerieness of the first game really gives out that sense of loneliness really well which I really
                        like.<br><br>

                        Now on to the story itself, the narrative in this game is honestly really good and is
                        the main reason why the 2nd game is praised so much by its fans. It's not mindblowing like
                        many people make it out to be, I really loved the development between Chell and GLaDOS' and how
                        well this builds up to the climax, even if the rest of the story felt more like popcorn flick
                        rather than well thought out writing.<br><br>

                        In some ways, there are definitely aspects of the game that are really improved upon the first
                        game. On the other hand, I still can't help but feel like something is missing. Nonetheless,
                        it's still very much Portal through its core in every way possible, and if you're a fan of the
                        first game, you'll definitely still love this one.<br><br>

                        <strong>3. Genshin Impact</strong> - I can certainly understand the amount of hate this game
                        gets for its pay to win gacha system and monotonous side quests. However, I can still continue
                        to walk past its glaring flaws and appreciate the many beautiful content it has to offer.<br><br>

                        This game in my opinion is a TRUE "fantasy" experience. The worldbuilding is beautiful, the RPG elements
                        genuinely feels fun albeit repetitive at times, the OST feels nostalgic, and the combat has
                        enough variety to keep you interested in trying out different playstyles and characters.<br><br>

                        Unfortunately, that is the extent of my praise for this game, because the plot itself is one of the
                        most predictable shit I've ever seen. It's just a run of the mill fantasy plot filled with
                        boring exposition dumps of historical figures I couldn't possibly care about. At some point I
                        even forget that the MC even has a sibling in the first place, which he/she is seemingly trying
                        to find throughout the plot.<br><br>

                        <strong>4. Assassin's Creed Origins</strong> - Another open-world game I genuinely love and the
                        only game from the AC franchise I actually bought and invested my time in. I have a passion for
                        games with a lot of exploration, and AC Origins definitely takes the cake.<br><br>

                        Unfortunately, this game has to go a little lower in the list, because it has most of the same
                        pitfalls with the usual RPG games. Repetitive side quests just for the sake of leveling up, and
                        the RPG items feel a little half-assed and pretty RPG typical. Thankfully, the combat of AC
                        Origins is more on the positive side and is the main reason why I loved this game so much.<br><br>

                        Another thing worth noting is the overarching storyline, which is ACTUALLY really good! It's
                        been so long since I've seen an AC game with a genuinely good plot since the Ezio trilogy (I
                        unfortunately haven't played the trilogy yet, but I will in the future). Bayek is a strong and
                        believable character, and I'd easily rank him as one of the best AC protagonists. One of the
                        best character developments I've seen.

                    <h1>8/10 - Great</h1>
                    <p>
                        <strong>1. osu!</strong> - Now if you're a friend of mine actually reading this, then you'll
                        probably wonder why I don't have this up in the masterpiece tier despite how much hours I put
                        into this game. Unfortunately, I have a love-hate relationship with this game.<br><br>

                        osu! is generally an amazing music game, especially coming from someone who is usually not a fan
                        of the rhythm genre. Everytime I casually play this game I always end up vibing with the music
                        and enjoying the game at the same time as well even if the game is hard, it's a great change of
                        pace to the usual "piano tiles-like" (idk what to fucking call it lmao) game I've seen usually.<br><br>

                        On the other hand, I hate this game for how unhealthy the gameplay is. Constant intense music
                        combined with insanely fast and difficult rhythm pretty much makes this the most "dopamine/junk-food"
                        game I've ever seen. This game, genuinely ruined my mental health, and I am not kidding. It
                        constantly whispers in the back of my head to keep grinding for performance points, despite
                        how constantly painful the harder levels are for me both physically and mentally. My hands are
                        constantly tired, my mind is constantly angry for not getting a high score, and most of all, I
                        couldn't stop playing this game despite all of that.<br><br>

                        I love osu!, but I will never go back to playing it ever again in my life. This game almost
                        destroyed me.<br><br>

                        <strong>2. Battlefield 1</strong> - Wow! I gotta say, this game probably has one of the best
                        depictions of war I've ever seen, both story-wise and gameplay wise. I haven't played enough
                        to get into detail about the game, but playing this game always makes you feel like you're
                        actually in a real war because of the constant chaos and teamplay.<br><br>

                        The campaign is short, but the short and self-contained stories have enough depth to make you
                        care for the characters despite the length. It always gives a sense of hopelessness which
                        really fits the theme of war, especially with the realistic depiction of war in this game.<br><br>

                        I unfortunately don't think it's masterpiece-level like most people tend to make it out to be,
                        because for the multiplayer I find the game a bit too punishing towards newer players because there's not really much
                        option to counter the better players. There's always so many angles to watch which genuinely
                        makes me panic sometimes.<br><br>

                        Nonetheless, this is probably the most unique "realistic" fps game I've seen.
                    </p>
                    <h1>7/10 - Decent</h1>
                    <p>
                        <strong>1. Geometry Dash</strong> - I love and hate this game for all the same reasons I have
                        with osu!, it's fun yet it's mentally tiring to play. On one hand, the levels are some of the
                        most unique and creative I've seen with a lot of different types of gameplay synced with
                        awesome music. On the other hand, this is the HARDEST GAME I'VE EVER FUCKING PLAYED.<br><br>

                        Recalling my memories of me trying to complete Bloodbath for over 20k+ attempts is a nightmare.
                        I constantly wasted my life doing nothing but do repeated sets of practice of certain parts
                        of the level. It was supposed to get boring over time, but I COULDN'T stop. This was the
                        moment I truly realized how bad my self-control was when it comes to my urges.<br><br>

                        Setting aside my personal experiences, I also think the levels get repetitive most of the time
                        despite having a few genuinely good ones. It's a constant cycle of generic designs that literally
                        make up 80% of its difficulty because of how hard it is to see with the added visuals.<br><br>

                        Nonetheless, this is one of the more unique platformers I've ever played, but it's the same
                        case with osu!, I will never get back to playing this game ever again.<br><br>

                        <strong>2. Minecraft</strong> - Minecraft is simple, and that's pretty much all I can say about
                        it. The appeal of this game is definitely its freedom to be creative as well as its exploration
                        content, but I feel like the grinding in this game feels too boring and off-putting for most
                        people. I doubt majority of the fanbase has even beaten this game in the first place.<br><br>

                        I don't have much to say about this game tbh, but it's a simple pastime if you're bored or
                        something. I don't think it's anything special.

                    <p>
                        <strong>1. Noita (6/10)</strong> - I can understand how much people truly love this game, because I do think
                        it's not your usual indie game with repetitive gameplay. In fact, I thought the gameplay was
                        pretty unique and the weapons and consumables have enough variety.<br><br>

                        Unfortunately, I couldn't really get into this game simply because of how punishing it is.
                        I know the appeal for this game is its difficulty, but it seems more like the enemies are
                        overpowered rather than trying to deal with difficult patterns with enemies. I've seen really
                        hard games that manage to be insanely fun despite the difficulty (although I haven't played
                        them), but I think Noita just felt too difficult in a sense that there's no way to get around them,
                        for better or for worse.<br><br>

                        I still enjoyed this game, but I don't think it's enough to keep me hooked, sorry.<br><br>

                        <strong>2. Watch Dogs 2 (5/10)</strong> - The most "Ubisoft" game I've ever seen, for better or for
                        worse. There's nothing really new it offers other than some cool stealth moments here and there,
                        it is essentially just a half-assed combination of GTA and Assassin's Creed.<br><br>

                        The parkour is also extremely buggy and clunky to play around with other than a few cool tricks,
                        it's literally just a copy paste of the climbing mechanics in most games out there. Nothing new
                        at all.<br><br>

                        The story is shit. It's a typical revenge story with literally 0 character development. Once
                        again, nothing new in that department sadly.<br><br>

                        Don't be fooled by its attractive looking hacking features, there's nothing complex about it at
                        all. Sneaking into enemy territory with a drone? Seen that shit everywhere already. Trying to
                        distract enemies? Just somehow be able to wirelessly break a nearby electrical hub to lure in
                        the enemies with no logical explanation as to... how. This game wants to be so smart with its
                        never-before-seen hacking concepts drilled into a GTA-like game, yet it ends up copying other
                        games that aren't even genius hacker games.<br><br>

                        It's not that this game is *frustrating* in any way, it's just... average. It adds absolutely
                        nothing to the gaming industry, but there's nothing painfully annoying about it. It's just
                        mediocre, which is unfortunately pretty typical of most Ubisoft games now these days.<br><br>

                        <strong>2. Roblox (5/10)</strong> - Generally a hit-or-miss game for me. It's constantly riddled
                        with repetitive tycoon or roleplay games for kids which makes the game a bit harder to enjoy
                        for an older audience. There are still some VERY good games that still make me come back to this
                        once in a while, especially Phantom Forces (I would rate PF a 9/10 as an individual game).
