                    <p>
                        1. <strong>Terraria</strong><br>
                        - OH MAN! I gotta say, this is definitely the most fun I've ever had playing an
                        adventure game. Comparing Terraria to Minecraft is honestly such a joke, even if
                        both games are mostly very different. Everything from the exploration, RPG-like
                        mechanics, combat, bosses, etc. It's just so fucking awesome to play tbh.<br><br>

                        Now I'll even go as far as to say this would've certainly be tied with VALORANT
                        for my number 1 spot, the only thing holding me back from doing so has something
                        to do with the final segments of hardmode, but for now let's get to the positives
                        first before the negatives.<br><br>

                        I think the biggest reason why I love this game so much has to do with its variety
                        for pretty much most of the game mechanics from the weapons to equipment to
                        monsters/bossfights, it gives me a lot of chances to just mess around and try out
                        new things and I'd almost never get bored of the game. Now the grinding may seem
                        tedious, but it feels very rewarding and fulfilling to be able to reach certain
                        goals in this game no matter how long it takes to grind it. And the bosses? GOD
                        that is just some of the best experiences I've had in this game, and maybe sort
                        of frustrating too because of how bad I am at this game LOL.<br><br>

                        Now despite all my praises, there are some very MINOR
                        nitpicks I have with this game. The main one being the corruption spread.
                        I DESPISE the corruption spread because all it does is waste your time and grief
                        your world, and even worse is the fact that you don't get any special reward
                        for cleansing the corruption. I would definitely be fine with this aspect of the
                        game if there were at least some extra benefits when you cleanse enough of the
                        corruption, but sadly it's no more than just a waste of time.<br><br>

                        The game also gets kind of quick later on throughout the pre-moonlord parts.
                        My favorite part about this game is definitely the more slower-paced exploration
                        of the early game content, which is exactly why I love this game so much.<br><br>

                        Nonetheless, this game will continue to be my all-time favorite in the far future
                        and I don't think any other game can top my enjoyment for this one.

                        2. <strong>Team Fortress 2</strong><br>
                        - The silliest and probably the funniest game I've ever played. As of now, I no longer
                        play this game often since long ago because the devs has pretty much abandoned this game,
                        so over time I grew bored of it because there was nothing new to experience anymore,
                        although I come back to it from time to time whenever I'm bored. Nonetheless, this game
                        still stands as my 3rd favorite game until now for many reasons.<br><br>

                        All 9 classes are extremely unique and fun to play with. While some of them may be a bit
                        OP, pretty much all of them have their own disadvantages and it really just depends on
                        your own playstyle. Also, TF2 is just a casual game to have fun with anyway, who cares
                        about unbalanced classes? The different types of weapons you can use to customize your
                        loadout just makes the overall experience feel a lot more unique.<br><br>

                        AND THE MEMES!! This game probably has the best community I've ever seen. While part of the
                        fanbase is definitely toxic, most of them are always so wholesome and just overall funny to
                        interact with. There's nothing I find more wholesome than a bunch of friendly heavies dancing
                        around in the open.<br><br>

                        The only reason I placed this a little lower in the list is because of how much Valve has pretty
                        much abandoned this game. While it's something I'd play once in a while when I'm bored, there's
                        nothing really new to experience anymore so much of my interest for this game has died down
                        recently. Nonetheless, still one of the best games I've ever played.

                        3. <strong>VALORANT</strong><br>
                        - It's an odd feeling coming from someone who used to partially hate the game,
                        mainly because I never actually played it myself. Being mainly a CS:GO player,
                        I really disliked how this game looked like from the outside because of all
                        the absurd abilities that seemed to really imbalance the overall format of the game.
                        Now this game has pretty much found its way to my number 1 very easily the moment I
                        started playing it.<br><br>

                        I really love the diversity in its agents and how they allow for a lot of new
                        and unique plays. While I find the idea to be very unbalanced for the type of
                        game it is, I think the enjoyment factor just nailed it for me here no matter
                        how unbalanced it may be. If you were to compare the agents to CS:GO's nades
                        and utilities, CS:GO just pales in comparison right now if you consider the fact
                        that it still has the same old gameplay since CS 1.6. Sure, there's changes with
                        movement and the nades, but the base game is still the same ever since its release
                        with no other unique stuff added to spice up the gameplay.<br><br>

                        With the current state of CS:GO, VALORANT is just easily the better game at
                        this point. Valve doesn't really put much care into CS:GO anymore and it's
                        no longer the main focus, and the community is almost dying (NA is pretty
                        much dead in CS now LMFAO). Despite all my criticism for CS:GO, it still
                        holds a special place in my heart for being THE first game to truly introduce
                        me to the FPS genre.<br><br>

                        Btw I main KAY/O, I just love how similar that agent is to pure CS:GO.

                        4. <strong>Genshin Impact</strong><br>
                        - Yes you heard it right, the one game I thought I would despise the most is my 4th favorite
                        game of all-time, and for a lot of good reasons.<br><br>

                        Despite being a gacha game with pay to win elements, much of the exploration content in this
                        is something I've always longed for ever since Terraria. I've always had so much love for
                        open-world games with a lot of fun exploration, and Genshin is no stranger to that. The sheer
                        amount of content there is to explore is just fascinating.<br><br>

                        This game is the TRUE "fantasy" experience, especially with how well it immerses you with its
                        worldbuilding and lore throughout the game with its OST, beautiful graphics, and amazing
                        exploration content. A lot of fantasy games I see fall into the same pitfall of repetitive
                        and boring quests alongside a generic fantasy plot, but I don't think Genshin is like that at all.
                        While I admit some of its side quests can be a bit stale, the main story doesn't feel repetitive at all.<br><br>

                        The combat is pretty fun to play around with. While it's not some masterpiece-level type combat,
                        there's enough variety to keep you interested in trying out different playstyles and such.
                        However, the enemies themselves don't really feel that difficult. Much of the game's difficulty
                        is more so because of the RPG leveling elements rather than the enemy's abilities themselves,
                        which feels a bit disappointing considering how well designed your own abilities are yet the most
                        you do with them is spam click attacks and a bunch of random abilities.<br><br>

                        My praise for the game ends there, because there a few problems I have with this game that could
                        detract from the enjoyment, one mainly being the gacha system. This is where the game becomes
                        "Pay to win", because you really don't have much luck trying to pull higher tier characters as a
                        F2P, so your only choice would be to pray and get something good or just pay. I HATE this system,
                        and this is way too common in other RPG games similar to Genshin. It completely destroys any sense
                        of "effort" for the game, because they just constantly try to whisper to you that they want money.
                        PLEASE don't fall down this rabbit hole! I enjoy the game a lot as F2P so far. The "true"
                        experience is the open-world RPG elements that keep you immersed in its beautiful worldbuilding
                        and story, not this shitty cash grab system just for the purpose of getting waifus.<br><br>

                        Another issue I have with the game, or more so just a minor nitpick, is that some of the more minor
                        quests can get really stale and only really exist just to level you up. This is unfortunately
                        present in most RPG games out there, so I'm not surprised at this point. This remains a minor
                        nitpick since it doesn't really bother me much at all.<br><br>

                        To conclude, Genshin Impact is easily the best and largest open-world game I have ever played,
                        at least if you stick with the main experience instead of falling for the gacha trap. If you want
                        to experience some amazing worldbuilding and a true "fantasy" experience, then you might like this
                        game. Don't be fooled by the game's reputation for being "pay to win", if you're just a casual
                        gamer then this game can be VERY casual. Those who say the game is pay to win are perfectionists
                        who waste their life farming for unnecessary characters for the sake of getting waifus, that shit
                        isn't worth it. Just enjoy the game how it's meant to be enjoyed, and you'll understand why I
                        constantly praise this game.

                        5. <strong>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</strong><br>
                        - Now if you're actually a friend of mine who is currently reading this, you'll probably wonder
                        why the heck is this game not my #1 favorite despite how much you see me play this game constantly.
                        It's not really more so that the core game is bad, it just doesn't age well at all because Valve
                        just doesn't care anymore.
