                        1. <strong>VALORANT</strong><br>
                        - It's an odd feeling coming from someone who used to partially hate the game,
                        mainly because I never actually played it myself. Being mainly a CS:GO player,
                        I really disliked how this game looked like from the outside because of all
                        the absurd abilities that seemed to really imbalance the overall format of the game.
                        Now this game has pretty much found its way to my number 1 very easily the moment I
                        started playing it.<br><br>

                        I really love the diversity in its agents and how they allow for a lot of new
                        and unique plays. While I find the idea to be very unbalanced for the type of
                        game it is, I think the enjoyment factor just nailed it for me here no matter
                        how unbalanced it may be. If you were to compare the agents to CS:GO's nades
                        and utilities, CS:GO just pales in comparison right now if you consider the fact
                        that it still has the same old gameplay since CS 1.6. Sure, there's changes with
                        movement and the nades, but the base game is still the same ever since its release
                        with no other unique stuff added to spice up the gameplay.<br><br>

                        With the current state of CS:GO, VALORANT is just easily the better game at
                        this point. Valve doesn't really put much care into CS:GO anymore and it's
                        no longer the main focus, and the community is almost dying (NA is pretty
                        much dead in CS now LMFAO). Despite all my criticism for CS:GO, it still
                        holds a special place in my heart for being THE first game to truly introduce
                        me to the FPS genre.<br><br>

                        Btw I main KAY/O, I just love how similar that agent is to pure CS:GO.

                        2. <strong>Terraria</strong><br>
                        - OH MAN! I gotta say, this is definitely the most fun I've ever had playing an
                        adventure game. Comparing Terraria to Minecraft is honestly such a joke, even if
                        both games are mostly very different. Everything from the exploration, RPG-like
                        mechanics, combat, bosses, etc. It's just so fucking awesome to play tbh.<br><br>

                        Now I'll even go as far as to say this would've certainly be tied with VALORANT
                        for my number 1 spot, the only thing holding me back from doing so has something
                        to do with the final segments of hardmode, but for now let's get to the positives
                        first before the negatives.<br><br>

                        I think the biggest reason why I love this game so much has to do with its variety
                        for pretty much most of the game mechanics from the weapons to equipment to
                        monsters/bossfights, it gives me a lot of chances to just mess around and try out
                        new things and I'd almost never get bored of the game. Now the grinding may seem
                        tedious, but it feels very rewarding and fulfilling to be able to reach certain
                        goals in this game no matter how long it takes to grind it. And the bosses? GOD
                        that is just some of the best experiences I've had in this game, and maybe sort
                        of frustrating too because of how bad I am at this game LOL.<br><br>

                        Despite all my praise for this game, I've mentioned before that this game falls
                        off a bit nearing the final segment of the game. I gotta be honest, my favorite
                        part of this game HAS to be pre-hardmode. I just love the slower pace of the earlier
                        parts of the game and how I get to take my time progressing and just overall having
                        fun, but the more later parts of the game feels a bit to stressful to actually even
                        enjoy it properly.<br><br>

                        Things like having to deal with the corruption/crimson spread and
                        the insanely faster pace of the later parts of the game is pretty boring to me.
                        I HATE the corruption spread honestly, all it does is grief your world for no reason
                        and cleansing it doesn't even feel fulfilling because of how tedious the process is, and
                        the fact that I don't even get some kind of special reward for cleansing all of the
                        corruption is just so disappointing tbh.<br><br>

                        Now despite all of that criticism, Terraria is just a fundamentally better game than
                        VALORANT in every way, it's just that it kind of falls off to me in the more later parts
                        of the game. Terraria still deserves all my praise and is easily the most fun I've
                        ever had playing a videogame.

                        3. <strong>Team Fortress 2</strong><br>
                        - The silliest and probably the funniest game I've ever played. As of now, I no longer
                        play this game often since long ago because the devs has pretty much abandoned this game,
                        so over time I grew bored of it because there was nothing new to experience anymore,
                        although I come back to it from time to time whenever I'm bored. Nonetheless, this game
                        still stands as my 3rd favorite game until now for many reasons.<br><br>

                        All 9 classes are extremely unique and fun to play with. While some of them may be a bit
                        OP, pretty much all of them have their own disadvantages and it really just depends on
                        your own playstyle. Also, TF2 is just a casual game to have fun with anyway, who cares
                        about unbalanced classes? The different types of weapons you can use to customize your
                        loadout just makes the overall experience feel a lot more unique.
