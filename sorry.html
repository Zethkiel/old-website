        [This is hosted on my website, but this is just a message separate from my actual website, so I'm not even gonna bother with the
        styling or formatting apart from font size just to make it readable.]<br><br>

        Hello there, to whoever is reading this, and if anyone is actually reading this but... I am quitting Discord for good. Can't say it's permanent, and I definitely won't delete my account, but I don't think I'm going to log back into my account unless I really feel like doing so. This is mainly directed to my most trusted group of friends (a.k.a. weed server, don't worry it's not actually about weed lmao), but if you are another friend outside the group somehow reading this then feel free to read it too.<br><br>

        I just want to preface this that, I am in no way trying to avoid anyone that is in Discord, but I have noticed I have developed an unhealthy emotional attachment to this group, and over time it has been making my social anxiety even worse. Everyday I constantly think about what a certain friend thinks about me, whether they get annoyed by me or they dislike chatting with me, or if they truly value me at all. This is absolutely NOT a romantic thing, but my obsession with my online friends are almost on the same level as, for example, you are obsessed with your crush and you constantly think about what they may feel about you.<br><br>

        I am very talkative in the group like any other, but like 80% of the time the first chat you will see is probably from me (there are definitely a few others who talk a lot as well, like Sethic). It made me feel like I'm the only person who is actually investing time into the group, even though my friends are inactive for good reasons like focusing on real life matters.<br><br>

        I also feel bad about the fact that the group is getting really inactive, since a lot of my friends are actually progressing in life and are focusing on real life things. Meanwhile I'm stuck in time, still the same person repeatedly viewing Discord statuses for no reason and checking Discord everyday for new messages. It made me feel extremely lonely, I finally realized how lonely it feels like to not have someone to talk to. I never bothered with this at all before I met this group being an introvert, but now I truly feel a genuine connection with my friends.<br><br>

        I regret not doing this much early, because it has made my mental health even worse over the past few months. This has been happening to me for like more than 4 months now, and I've only taken action until now.

        This obsession and addiction is almost affected my studies as well. Instead of taking my time to study for school, or learn coding, I end up wasting hours of my time staring at Discord even when literally no one is chatting. I constantly feel like I'm the only one in the group who is this lame, stupid, and pathetic. I mean, I get fucking obsessed with what a certain friend thinks about some of the anime I love, and I end up getting hurt when they didn't like it as much as I did. I constantly view their profile to see if they've finished the anime or not. THAT'S SO FUCKING LAME I KNOW!!!! IT'S SO FUCKING STUPID!!!!!!!! I know how fucking stupid that is but I still can't stop. This makes me waste like fucking 4 hours of my time a day when all of that time could've been spent doing more productive stuff.<br><br>

        Of course this isn't just a case with Discord, my addiction with gaming is also the same case. I constantly play fucking Genshin for more than 5 hours a day and waste all the time I could've used doing something more fun and productive. My self-control is terrible and no matter how much I take a break or delete these games, I still end up coming back.<br><br>

        I have already tried taking a break from Discord for a month, but I still relapsed back into the same old addictions afterwards. I considered taking another break from Discord, but then I realized how much that would just lead into a constant cycle of me quitting then coming back in a bit.<br><br>

        I want to end this constant cycle of frustration and obsession. I want to focus on my life and do something truly fulfilling. I have dreams and goals I want to achieve too, and I don't want to waste my life constantly doing the stupidest shit ever. I am so sorry if this feels so sudden, and I don't know whether anyone who's reading this is confused or probably secretly laughing at how pathetic I am, or if my friends will even miss me at all, but I'm really tired and I want to rest for a while. I don't think I'm ever coming back in the next few months.<br><br>

        I obviously don't want to completely cut off contact, so I'm going to link my email or private Instagram below (made the instagram solely for this purpose, so you won't find any posts or something). Alternatively, some of my friends also have me added on some other platforms (Kleinz on AniList, multiple people on Steam, Tofu on Genshin), and I will continue to go online there at times so you are free to contact me there. At least this way I'll know which people do genuinely want to talk to me, at the very least I can feel some reassurance this way. I do not blame anyone just because you guys are inactive or don't talk to me or don't feel like talking. This is all on me and my fault alone for getting too emotionally attached with this group.<br><br>

        That's all from me, I'm sorry again. Goodbye.
