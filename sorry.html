        [This is hosted on my website, but this is just a message separate from my actual website, so I'm not even gonna bother with the
        styling or formatting apart from font size just to make it readable.]<br><br>

        Hello there to whoever is reading this. I'm very sorry if this feels so sudden, but I plan on quitting Discord for good. It's *probably* not permanent, but I do know for sure that I'm not coming back until the far future.<br><br>

        This message is mainly directed towards my most trusted group of friends (a.k.a. weed server, don't worry it's not actually about weed lmao), but if you're someone else outside this group of friends then you are still free to read this.<br><br>

        I noticed that I've recently developed an unhealthy emotional attachment to this group, and over time it has been affecting my school and is also making my social anxiety even worse. I have a low self-esteem, but I do what I can to make people like me. Everyday I constantly think about what certain friends may feel about me, whether they find me annoying or they don't enjoy talking to me, I always think about what I can do to make these people like me more.<br><br>

        This group is pretty much half-dead and not a lot of people talk anymore, but I am still an extremely active member of the group, and like 80% of the time the first chat you'll see is from me (apart from a select few like Sethic, Kleinz, etc). It made me think about the fact that I'm the only one who is investing way too much time for this group, even if most of my friends these days are inactive for good reasons like focusing on real life matters and such.<br><br>

        All of my friends are actually progressing in life, meanwhile I'm here still stuck in time, repeatedly viewing Discord statuses for no reason and checking Discord everyday for new messages. With how inactive the group is, I've only realized just now how lonely it feels like to not have someone to talk to.<br><br>

        It made me think that I'm probably not a priority for these people, realized that they most likely have IRL friends they value more than some random guy online that they've never even met face to face.<br><br>

        I don't regret meeting this group. In fact, I don't think I would've changed for the better if I never met these people, but I regret that my first genuine connection with people was through online. Every single one of my so-called IRL "friends" treated me like shit and like a child who doesn't even know basic conversation just because I'm often quiet and sometimes say weird shit, so I ended up escaping into the online world to find true friends there. My first true friends being made online made me develop unhealthy obsessive habits that you otherwise wouldn't get with IRL friends.<br><br>

        Everyday I think about all of this that I wrote, I end up wasting 4 hours or more of my time that could've been spent doing something genuinely fun and productive. It's not even just Discord, my addiction with gaming is also a similar case that has been affecting my studying a lot, constantly playing games for more than 5 hours a day.<br><br>

        I have tried so much methods to help with this: I tried taking a break from Discord and blocking the website through chrome extensions and such, but I end up deleting these website blockers and reactivate my Discord account because I always get that constant feeling of me missing out on new messages. I have considered taking another break from Discord, but I realized how much that would just lead into a constant cycle of me quitting and then coming back immediately.<br><br>

        I want to end this constant cycle of frustration and obsession. I want to focus on my life and do something truly fulfilling. I have dreams and goals I want to achieve too, and I don't want to waste my life constantly doing the stupidest shit ever. I am so sorry if this feels so sudden, and I don't know whether anyone who's reading this is confused or probably secretly laughing at how pathetic I am, or if my friends will even miss me at all, but I'm really tired and I want to rest for a while. I don't think I'm ever coming back in the next few months.<br><br>

        I really don't want to completely cut off contact, so I'll be linking my email below if ever that you really do still want to talk to me. Alternatively, some of my friends have me added on some other platforms (Kleinz on AniList, multiple people on Steam, Tofu on Genshin, etc.), you are free to contact me there since I'll continue to go online there once in a while. At least this way, I'll know which people really do enjoy talking to me. At the very least I can feel some reassurance this way.<br><br>

        I don't blame anyone just because you guys are inactive or if you actually don't like talking to me, this is all on me and my fault alone for getting too emotionally attached with this group.<br><br>

        That's all from me, I'm sorry again if this felt too sudden. Goodbye.
